## What you should know

My identity is not based on my work-life. I only live and breathe software
engineering during **my** daily peak hours. This lifestyle has led me to grow in
a way that has allowed me to advance faster than your average engineer while not
becoming a workaholic using the **excuse**

> "I love what I do."

You can love what you do and still have a personal life and advance. However,
if you do prefer that life, I respect that - but I'm not going to share that
choice ever. There is a reason why you consistently hear that people on thier
death-bed say:

> "I wish I had worked less and spent more time with my friends/family."

Work smarter, not harder. The 9-5 work-based culture is outdated and your brain
only has so much cognitive energy to use each day. This means that by working
more than 6-8 hours...you are doing more harm than good - both for your team
and most importantly, yourself.
